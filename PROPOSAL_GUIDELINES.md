# Treasury Proposal Guidelines
We are improving the ways that we reward all contributors in the Beefy community. We try to be as fair as possible and use the treasury in an effective manner.
One of the mechanisms to reward dev work are treasury bounties. Bounties can be targeted to reward anything from a Github issue, a larger initiative, or even a developer.

## When should you create a proposal?
1. You are a dev and would like to help with a task but want or need a compensation to tackle it. 
2. You are a dev who already did a task and would like some compensation for the effort.
3. You are not a dev but feel like a task is particularly important and/or difficult.
4. If you are a dev with some cred with Beefy, you can propose a regular reward for continued contributions. 

## Steps

### 1. Fill out a proposal
Go to [vote.beefy.finance](https://vote.beefy.finance) and click on the big square that says "Beefy.Finance". Once you're in, click on the [New Proposal](https://vote.beefy.finance/#/beefy/create) button.

#### A - Title
Going with "Bounty of $<AMOUNT> for <ISSUE_TITLE>" is a good standard.

#### B - Body

You need to make clear why the community should spend those funds to help it grow or sustain itself.

#### Choices

The basic choices to give are a Yes and a No.

1. Yes
2. No

Feel free to add aditional options that might make the proposal more likely to pass, or to give you additional info. for example:

1. Yes, full bounty 
2. Yes, 70% of the funds
3. No, too expensive
4. No, not relevant 

#### Selecting Dates 
When deciding how much time to give the community to deliverate, it's important to take budget size into account.

- +$10k --> at least 7 days
- +$5k --> at least 4 days
- $1k-$5k --> at least 2 days
- Less then $1k can have 24h 

Unless there's a particular reason, the starting date should be pretty close to when you're creating the proposal. There's no need to wait much before the voting begins.

### 2. Engage the community
You should go to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yq8wfHd) and engage the community on why the proposal is important. 
The #development channel is a good place to get the attention of other beefy devs. If you can post in #citadel, that's a great place to get the atention influential members of Beefy as well.

### 3. Outcome
If the proposal passed, you'll be contacted by a member of the team, or feel free to PM anyone with the team tag on discord to move forwards.
