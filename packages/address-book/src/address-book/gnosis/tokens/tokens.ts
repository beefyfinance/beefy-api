This can be staked to receive existing rewards (BAL and bbaUSD) from Balancer, in addition to a share of any BAL earned by Aura (read more about the fees), and additional AURA. This minting process is irreversible however users can trade their auraBAL back to BAL through an incentivised liquidity pool.',
